<h2>About this Site</h2>
<p>Hydrangea Fashion and Beauty is a site that informs viewers about the latest and oldest fashion trends. The homepage of this website outlines its overall purpose, telling viewers all about what can be found on this site and it has a clear navigation area. There are four different linked web pages titled “celebrity style,” “street style,” “models,” and “designers.” “Celebrity style” shows viewers various celebrities in a table and a description of their individual style. There are also images of their formal and informal style. “Street style” is a page in which viewers can learn about how street fashion has changed over time and viewers can also take inspiration from the images included. “Models” has a range of different supermodels and their most and least famous looks. In this page viewers can see why some models' looks were unpopular and can see why they should and should not dress similarly. “Designers” is a page which identifies many popular designers and their designs on various models. 
</p>
<p>No code has been directly copied from another site. Only references have been taken from 'W3Schools'.

<h2>Wireframe</h2>
<img src="wireframe.jpg" alt="">
<p>This wireframe of my homepage was drawn prior to creating my website. Minimal changes were made to it when creating the website. The only significant change made was the exclusion of a table in the homepage. I thought this wasn’t an appropriate page to include a table since I did not have any information to insert in this format. A table was included in the “celebrity style” page instead. 
</p>
<h2>Bonus Marks</h2>
<p>
    - The use of many external CSS files has allowed for the website to look colour coordinated and maintain a consistent feeling and look throughout. 
    </p>
    <p>- The logo in this website was originally created and designed by myself using “Sketch Book.” 
    </p>
    <p>- Efforts have been made to make the site responsive. This is evident in the footer where the search bar can be typed in. Buttons in the footer also change colour when the user hovers over them and their cursor changes to pointing.
    </p>
    <p>- All CSS is completely original.
